## Single Neuron

The following section contains the code and datasets for use exploring the single neuron perceptron. The single neuron is an important building block in larger more complicated neural networks and presents a good example upon which to explore various activation functions. In the example SingleNeuron.ipynb we will explore the single neuron percpetron and use the model to predict on a binary classification problem.

Packages Used:
1. Matplotlib
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. mlxtend
5. sklearn

The dataset used in the example is the citrus.csv file that can be found within this folder. The file contians 10000 instances of oranges and grapefruits with the attributes diameter, weight, red, green, and blue. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com as a CSV. For model performance comparison note that this dataset is also used for the implementation of the multi-layer network and Principal Components Analysis.
