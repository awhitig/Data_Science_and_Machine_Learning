## Single Neuron

The following section contains the code and datasets for use exploring the single neuron perceptron. The single neuron is an important building block in larger more complicated neural networks and presents a good example upon which to explore various activation functions. In the example SingleNeuron.ipynb we will explore the single neuron percpetron and use the model to predict on a binary classification problem.

Packages Used:
1. Matplotlib
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. mlxtend
5. sklearn

The dataset citrus.csv used for the example can also be found within this folder.
