## Multi-Layer Neural Network

In this directory you will find an implementation of a multi-layer neuralnetwork from TensorFlow. This network will be used to solve and example logistic regresssion problem for binary classification. In addition, the file will make clear the use of learning rates in neural networks and the process of gradient descent. 

Packages Used:
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. seaborn
5. tensorflow
6. sklearn
7. mlxtend

The dataset used in the example is the citrus.csv file that can be found within this folder. The file contians 10000 instances of oranges and grapefruits with the attributes diameter, weight, red, green, and blue. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com as a CSV.
