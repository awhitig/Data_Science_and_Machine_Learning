# Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning
This is a repository of machine learning techniques/algorithms for the course INDE-577 Data Science and Machine Learning at Rice University for the Spring 2022 semester by Andrew Whitig (MSTAT). 

Included will be a collection of supervised learning methods as well as a few unsupervised learning methods applied to various data sets ubtained from Kaggle.com.

# Topics 

1. Simple Perceptron (Supervised)
2. Multi-layer neural network
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Decison Trees
5. Regression Trees
6. Random Forest
7. Bagging
8. Boosting
9. PCA
10. K-Means

# Tools

All topics are demonstrated in Python with a .ipynb file containing a brief description of the method and data as well as an example. Most methods are implemented using either TensorFlow or Scikit-Learn but some are implemented from scratch.
