## Ensemble

The ensemble learning algoritms covered in this section consist of bagging and boosting, two ways of combining simpler learners for improved robustness and accuracy. The bagging model focuses on classifying countries by region using continuous data from a global happiness survey. The boosting model also seeks to classify the same data in the section describing ADA boosting. In the boosting.ipynb file the gradient descent algorithm seeks to regress starting median salaries by college type and region. Both ensemble learning files build on decision trees as their base learners. 

Packages Used:
1. matplotlib
2. pandas
3. seaborn
4. sklearn

There are two datasets used in this section, the first is 2015.cav which contains global happiness survey responses in continuous form. Additionally the region designation of the countries is used for the classification labels. This dataset is used by both the bagging and boosting notebooks as an example. It is also used in K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and K-means. The next dataset consists of three files degrees-that-pay-back.csv, salaries-by-college-type.csv, and salaries-by-region.csv. I have left joined these files to create on regression dataset with categorical predictors college type and region. This dataset is used for the boosting notebook to display gradient descent. It also appears in the trees section.
