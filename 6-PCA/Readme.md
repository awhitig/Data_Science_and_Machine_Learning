## Principal Components Analysis

Principle Components Analysis (PCA) is a method for clustering and for dimensionality reduction. In this section we will deisplay the viability of PCA as an unsupervised method for clustering.

Packages Used:
1. matplotlib
2. Numpy
3. sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. mlxtend

The dataset used to disply the clustering ability of PCA is the citrus.csv dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. The data consists of five continuous predictor variables, diameter, weight, red, green, and blue, and one binary variable grapefruit or orange. This dataset is also used in the single neuron and multi-layer network sections.
