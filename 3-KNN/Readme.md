## K Nearest Neighbor

K nearest neighbor (KNN) is a simple machine learning algorithm which seeks to make predictions on data by comparing its distance to similar data. In order to demonstrate the abilities of KNN as a model two versions of a KNN (from scratch and from sklearn) have been implemented in the file KNN.ipynb. The KNN algorithm is applied to the classification of countries into regions based on the results of a happiness survey.

Packages Used:
1. matplotlib
2. sklearn
3. seaborn
4. numpy
5. pandas

The dataset used in this example 2015.csv consists of survey data from various countries about happiness including strength of contributing factors. The countries are also classified by region which is used as the categorical response. Modifications were made to the region grouping to help balance group sizes as described in the code. Note that for model comparison the same dataset has been used for the decision trees, ensemble, and k-means examples. The dataset was originally obtained as a CSV from Kaggle.com.
