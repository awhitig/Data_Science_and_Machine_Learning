## K-Means 

The K-Means unsupervised learning model can be used similarly to PCA as a method of clustering or dimensionality reduction. In this section, the K-Means algorithm will be used to perform unsupervised clustering on a subset of a global happiness survey of countries. The regions of each of these countries are assigned to will serve as the clusters.

Packages Used:
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. sklearn
4. pandas
5. seaborn

The dataset for the K-Means algorithm example come from a global happiness survey which seeked to rank the most happy countries. These countries are all assigned to regions which have been augmented by me for parity amongst the groups sizes where possible. The happiness score of each country and the weighting of economy on that score were used as the two-dimesnions for the K-means based on the appearance of clusters in the pairplot. This dataset was obtained as a csv from Kaggle.com and is used in the examples of the KNN, decision trees, and ensemble algortithms for model comparison.
